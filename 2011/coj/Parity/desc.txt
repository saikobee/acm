Parity

description

We define the parity of an integer N as the sum of the bits in binary representation computed modulo two. As an example, the number 21 = 10101 has three 1s in its binary representation so it has parity 3 (mod 2), or 1. In this problem you have to calculate the parity of an integer 1 <= I <= 2147483647 (2^31-1). Then, let start to work...

input specification

Each line of the input has an integer I and the end of the input is indicated by a line where I = 0 that should not be processed.

output specification

For each integer I in the input you should print one line in the form "The parity of B is P (mod 2)." where B is the binary representation of I.

description

Transform the algebraic expression with brackets into RPN form (Reverse Polish Notation). Two-argument operators: +, -, *, /, ^ (priority from the lowest to the highest), brackets ( ). Operands: only letters: a,b,...,z. Note that the resulting expression must be evaluated from right to left, that is, a+b+c must be evaluated as c+b+a, but respecting the priorities of operators.

input specification

t [the number of expressions <= 100] expression [length <= 400] [other expressions] Text grouped in [ ] does not appear in the input file.

output specification

The expressions in RPN form, one per line, ready to be evaluated from right to left.

sample input

((a+t)*((b+a+c)^(c+d)))

sample output
